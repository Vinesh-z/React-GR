        <p>If your application contains a large number of form groups, we recommend building a higher-level component encapsulating a complete field group that renders the label, the control, and any other necessary components. </p>
        <p>We don't provide this out-of-the-box, because the composition of those field groups is too specific to an individual application to admit a good one-size-fits-all solution.</p>
        <p>If you want to have elements in your form styled as plain text, use the plaintext prop on FormControls to remove the default form field styling and preserve the correct margin and padding.</p>
    </div>
